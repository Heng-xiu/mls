<b>By the end of this class, I hope</b>:
<ul>
  <li>You will be able to apply state of the art ML algorithms in whatever problem you are interested in at scale and learn how to deal with unique challenges that only may happen when building real-world production-ready ML/AI systems;</li>
  <li>I also hope I can convey my own excitement about ML/AI systems to you. </li>
  <li>You are well qualified for doing research in ML/AI systems research.</li>
</ul>
