<b>By the end of this class, I hope</b>:
<ul>
  <li>You will be able to apply state of the art ML algorithms, in whatever problem you are interested in, at scale and learn how to deal with unique challenges that only may happen when building real-world **production-ready AI/ML systems**.</li>
  <li>You will be able to do **AI at the Edge**; there will be projects for an end-to-end, cloud-to-edge, hardware + software infrastructure for facilitating the deployment of AI-based solutions using Edge TPU/NVIDIA Jetson Nano and TensorFlow Lite.</li>
  <li>I also hope I can convey **my own excitement** about AI/ML systems to you. </li>
  <li>You are well qualified for doing **research in AI/ML systems**.</li>

</ul>
